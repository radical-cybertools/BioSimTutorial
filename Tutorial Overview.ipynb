    "\n",
    "1. introduce problem:\n",
    "   1. quantitative comparison of transitions: PSA\n",
    "   2.  large ensembles and all-pairs: pleasingly parallel with radical.pilot (advantage: existing infrastructure, just run serial jobs)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. describe data\n",
    "   * MD trajectories\n",
    "   * numbers, sizes\n",
    "\n",
    "3. describe algorithms – briefly\n",
    "   1.  PSA: rmsd fitting and metric calculation (Hausdorff or Fréchet)\n",
    "   2.  specifics of the partitioning of the ensemble for radical.pilot\n",
    "\n",
    "4. description of frame works\n",
    "   * MDAnalysis (brief)\n",
    "   * radical.pilot – or more likely you will have done this previously ?\n",

    "\n",
    "### MDAnalysis\n",
    "\n",
    "More Details\n",

    "The basic python script for executing PSA through MDAnalysis is show in the [MDAnalysis Notebook](./01_mda/MDAnalysis.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "### RADICAL PIlot\n",
    "The Pilot-Abstraction has been used to execute task-based workloads on distributed resources. A Pilot-Job is a placeholder job that is submitting to the resource management system and is used as a container for a dynamically determined set of compute tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Pilot-Abstraction supports heterogeneous resources, including cloud, HPC, and Hadoop resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Pilot Abstraction](./figures/interoperable_pilot_job.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The following example demonstrates how the Pilot-Abstraction is used to execute the PSA algorithm described.\n",
