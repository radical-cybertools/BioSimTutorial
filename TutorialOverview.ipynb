    "## 1. Background\n",
    "The Pilot-Abstraction has been used to execute task-based workloads on distributed resources. A Pilot-Job is a placeholder job that is submitting to the resource management system and is used as a container for a dynamically determined set of compute tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Pilot-Abstraction supports heterogeneous resources, including cloud, HPC, and Hadoop resources.\n",

    "\n",
    "We will discuss how to get started with RADICAL-Pilot, followed by simple examples for RADICAL-Pilot, first \"locally\" and then \"remotely\" on XSEDE supercomputers. In the end you should be able to launch a RADICAL-Pilot script either \"locally\" or \"remotely\".\n",
